  
Vectors are used to represent many things around us: from forces like gravity, acceleration, friction, stress and strain on structures, to computer graphics used in almost all modern-day movies and video games. Vectors are an important concept, not just in math, but in physics, engineering, and computer graphics, so you're likely to see them again in other subjects.

> 1) **Scalar :** Has only magnitude (ex: Speed)
> 2) **Vector :** Has a magnitude and direction (ex: Velocity - speed + direction)
> 3) **Real Coordinate Space :**
> 	Vector  
> 	All possible real-valued tuples that belong to the Real Coordinate Space.
> 	2D real coordinated space: Represented as R^2
> 	n-D real coordinated space: Represented as R^n
> 	A scalar/matrix/vectors in the "Real Coordinated Space" cannot have imaginary numbers in them.
