Data is the most important input for your machine learning models. Youâ€™ll need access to data when training machine learning models, and the trained model needs data as input to generate predictions.

Imagine you're a data scientist and have been asked to train a machine learning model.

You aim to go through the following six steps to plan, train, deploy, and monitor the model:

1. **Define the problem**: Decide on what the model should predict and when it's successful.
2. **Get the data**: Find data sources and get access.
3. **Prepare the data**: Explore the data. Clean and transform the data based on the model's requirements.
4. **Train the model**: Choose an algorithm and hyperparameter values based on trial and error.
5. **Integrate the model**: Deploy the model to an endpoint to generate predictions.
6. **Monitor the model**: Track the model's performance.
